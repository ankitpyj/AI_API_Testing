    Analyze a failed API test using an LLM.

You are an expert software tester.

Analyze the following failed API test.

Test Result:

{json.dumps(result, indent=2)}

Explain the failure using ONLY evidence present
in the test result.

Important rules:

1. Clearly distinguish facts from hypotheses.

2. Do NOT assume an internal service, database,
dependency, or business rule failed unless the test result provides evidence for it.

3. If the exact root cause cannot be determined,
explicitly say that it cannot be determined.

4. A possible cause must be phrased as a hypothesis.

5. Do not recommend changing the HTTP status code
unless the test evidence or API contract supports it.

Return ONLY valid JSON using this format:

{{
    "summary": "Short explanation of the failure",
    "possible_cause": "Likely reason for the failure",
    "severity": "Low | Medium | High | Critical",
    "recommendation": "What should the developer investigate or fix"
}}

Do not invent information that is not supported
by the test result.

Keep each JSON value short.
